He was exceptionally punctual and reliable in his work, and he managed to make a noticeable impact on the project he contributed to in a short amount of time. Both his technical skills and communication style were of a high standard, allowing him to collaborate smoothly with the team and quickly take on responsibilities independently.

Robbe not only writes clear and efficient code, but also takes the time to understand the bigger picture. As a result, he delivers a final product that is both functional and user-friendly. His dedication, professionalism, and ability to communicate technical concepts clearly make him an exceptionally valuable asset to any team. I wouldn’t hesitate for a second to work with him again if the opportunity arises.',
